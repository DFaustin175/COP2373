#Application that scans an email provided by the user for each of 30 keywords or phrases most likely to be used in an email
#After scanning the email based on the points accumulated during the scan it will receive a spam score. This score describes how likely the email is spam.

#Function that loops through list of spam words and phrases and increase the spam score of the email based on the amount of words and phrases present within it

#Then within this function display the spam score, the likelihood of the message being spam and the words/phrases which caused it to be spam
